# Find maximum profit in array of currency exhange rates during a given time period

This is a C# task. Please develop this as a console app.
    
Assume an array of integers representing the price of EUR against another currency during a given time period.

You need to know “what would be the best price to buy and the best price to sell so I could achieve maximum profit?”

### Example #1:
[4, 2, 8, 6, 7, 12, 3, 25, 21, 30, 1]

The answer of the above would be to buy at the 2nd value (2) and sell at the 10th value(30) for a maximum profit of 28.

### Example #2:
[45, 56, 5, 7, 3, 57, 23, 24, 12, 2, 40]

The answer of the above would be to buy at the 5th value(3) and sell at the 6th value(57) for a maximum profit of 54.

### Notes:
Do not sort the array.Remember, the values are values that happened over a time period, so sorting them would make no sense.

Program input: array of integers
Program output: “buy at *buyPrice* and sell at *sellPrice* for a maximum profit of *maximumProfit*”

You should also write unit tests and test various scenarios to ensure that your actual output is the expected output.
